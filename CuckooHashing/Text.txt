load factor => indicates the average number of keys present per list in our hash table.

load factor = ___________number of keys______  
                        size of hashtable

             when nu_of_keys == size_of_hash_tables then we get close to O(1)

Methods used to prevent collisions
1.Open adressing => Here we store all the elements inside the hashtable instead of cahining the element to the hashtable.
2.Linear probing =>here we llok at the subsequent hash value for an empty cell and insert our element once we find the room for it.
  cell at hash(x) is empty check wether cell at hash(x+1) is empty then hash(x+2),hash(x+3)....
3.Quadratic probing => hash(x) if it occupied we move to hash(x+1^2), else hash(x+1^2)...

4.Perfect Hashing - Cuckoo hashing => the most perfect hashing technique.
